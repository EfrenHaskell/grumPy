grumPy Compiler

--
Note:
Compiler is kinda just starting to be developed.
Have been a bit distracted by University work, Youtube and my dream to rank up finally in valorant.
Will hopefully have a functioning compiler by the end of the month
The end goal is to bootstrap the grumPy compiler
grumGrum will ideally incorporate a more extensive group of packages and APIs for software development
The lexer file will most likely be removed from the final project

Description:
    The grumPy Compiler is a simplified, somewhat nonsense compiler written in python.
   The assembly file produced by grumPy is only NASM assembler compatible.
   NASM is super dope. Show the developers and the maintenance team some love
